# vue-express-mongodb-app

Test project using Vue.js, Node.js with Express, and MongoDB Atlas.

Just messing around with MEVN stack so decided to add the frontend and backend into a single repo.

In production, I could add the client folder to git ignore but for the sake of showing my work I kept it in.

I deployed this project on Heroku, here's the link: https://vue-express-mongodb-app.herokuapp.com/ .
